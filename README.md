# Parkour Tweaks

Parkour Tweaks is a fully customizable resource pack designed for parkour players. The goal of this pack is to provide more accurate block models for blocks where the default model doesn't align with the collision box.
## Customization

Parkour Tweaks uses [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts) by [JFronny](https://modrinth.com/user/JFronny) for customization. The mod is not required but it is heavily recommended.
